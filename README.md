### **GraphQL schema and resolvers self-composition (Code-first approach)**

Thanks to [type-graphql](https://typegraphql.com), **AtlasGQL** is capable of generating the GraphQL schema at- run-time during the bootstrap.

This means that you don't need to know GraphQL for using it, you can write your own resolvers in TypeScript; go [here](https://typegraphql.com/docs/introduction.html) for further information.

If you feel confident already, you can jump straight to the "example" folder where there is a ready-to-run demo of a server implementing AtlasGQL.

### **Tech. stack:**

1. TypeScript 3
2. Apollo Server 3
3. Express 4 + ejs
4. GraphQL 15

### **Easily configurable**

The library can be configured following the JSON oject below. That's all you need to do before having it running.

```json
{
  "version": "1.1.0",
  "id": "eu-server-foobar",
  "name": "FooBar Server",
  "defaults": {
    "port": 3000,
    "addr": "localhost"
  },
  "graphql": {
    "path": "/graphql"
  },
  "rest": {
    "path": "/static"
  },
  "views": {
    "src": "__root/server/views/",
    "engine": "ejs"
  },
  "cors": {
    "origin": ["*", "https://studio.apollographql.com"],
    "methods": ["GET", "HEAD", "PUT", "PATCH", "POST", "DELETE"],
    "enabled": true,
    "preflightContinue": false,
    "optionsSuccessStatus": 200
  }
}
```

### **Extending the GraphQL context**

In the GraphQL world, a context is an object (or a function) that returns an object which will be shared across all the resolvers.

### **Shaping and expanding the GraphQL response**

The GraphQL response can be re-shaped or expanded using a custom function that will return the new response.

### **Adding GraphQL middlewares**

For the Express framework, middlewares are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named "next".

### **Working with custom validation rules**

The so called "validation rules" are additional GraphQL validations that get applied to client-specified queries.

For further information: (default rules already applied [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/tree/master/src/validation/rules](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/tree/master/src/validation/rules))

### **About auto-generated TypeScript definitions**

The application generates a types definition file and exposes it by accessing the (`{rest_endpoint}/types`) endpoint.

### **Setup**

```
npm i typescript@4.x @types/express@4.x apollo-server-types@3.x graphql@15.x --also=dev
npm i atlasgql type-graphql@1.x class-validator@0.x
```

### **A quick example of a consumer app (take your time to go through it)**

```ts
import { GraphQLRequestContext, GraphQLResponse } from 'apollo-server-types';
import { CustomRoute, ENV, EVENTS, Middlewares, Server } from 'atlasgql';
import express, { NextFunction, Request, Response } from 'express';
import {
  GraphQLError,
  GraphQLFormattedError,
  ValidationContext,
} from 'graphql';
import { PerformancesResolver } from './models/perf/perf.resolver';
import DefaultConfs from './serviceconfig.json';

// A list of your own resolvers (see below for an example)
const resolvers = [PerformancesResolver];

/**
 * Extends the GraphQL context
 */
const customContext = ({ req, res }) => ({
  requestHash: Math.random().toString(16),
});

/**
 * Extends or re-shape the response
 */
const formatResponse = (
  response: GraphQLResponse,
  _requestContext: GraphQLRequestContext<Record<string, any>>
) => ({
  ...response,
  extensions: {
    ...response.extensions,
    executedAt: new Date().getTime(),
  },
});

/**
 *  Extends or re-shape the error response
 */
const formatError = (error: GraphQLError): GraphQLFormattedError => ({
  ...error,
  extensions: {
    ...error.extensions,
    failedAt: new Date().getTime(),
  },
});

/**
 * Gets executed before the Apollo server is initialized
 */
const preInitHook = () => {
  console.log('[Hook] The server is starting.');
};

/**
 * Gets executed after the Apollo server has been initialized
 */
const postInitHook = () => {
  console.log('[Hook] The server has been started.');
};

/**
 * A list of Express middlewares
 */
const middlewares: Middlewares = {
  beforeApollo: [
    (_req: express.Request, _res: express.Response, next: () => void) => {
      // This will run before Apollo
      return next();
    },
  ],
  beforeApolloDev: [
    (_req: express.Request, _res: express.Response, next: () => void) => {
      // This will run before Apollo but only on a DEV instance
      return next();
    },
  ],
};

// A list of custom routes
const restRoutes: CustomRoute[] = [
  {
    // Accessible at "://addr:port/static/hello"
    path: 'hello',
    handler: (_req: Request, res: Response, _next: NextFunction) => {
      res.send('Hello :-)');
    },
  },
];

// See: https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/tree/main/src/validation/rules
const validationRules: ((context: ValidationContext) => any)[] = [];

// Note: the Apolo Studio will be disabled on production instances
const env = ENV.DEV;

// Note: an identifier that can be useful in case of multiple envs
const envId = 1;

// Finally, the server instance
const server = new Server(env, envId, {
  serverOpts: {
    customContext,
    middlewares,
    hooks: {
      preInit: preInitHook,
      postInit: postInitHook,
    },
    formatResponse,
    formatError,
    validationRules,
    restRoutes,
    resolvers,
  },
  defaultConfs: DefaultConfs,
});

// Registering the events
server.events.once(EVENTS.APOLLO_READY, () => {
  console.log('[Event] Apollo is ready');
});
server.events.once(EVENTS.GRAPHQL_LISTENING, () => {
  console.log('[Event] GraphQL is ready');
});
server.events.once(EVENTS.WEB_INTERFACE_READY, () => {
  console.log('[Event] The web interface is ready');
});
server.events.on(EVENTS.ERROR, (error: NodeJS.ErrnoException) => {
  console.warn('[Event]', error.message, error.stack);
});
server.events.once(EVENTS.EXIT, () => {
  console.log('[Event] Bye!');
});

// Good to go
server.start();
```

**models/perf/perf.resolver.ts**

```ts
import { Query, Resolver } from 'type-graphql';
import { Performances } from './perf.type';

@Resolver((of) => Performances)
export class PerformancesResolver {
  @Query((returns) => Performances, {
    description: 'Returns performances information about the server',
  })
  public async performances(): Promise<Performances> {
    return new Performances();
  }
}
```

**models/perf/perf.type.ts**

```ts
import { freemem, totalmem } from 'os';
import { Field, ObjectType } from 'type-graphql';

@ObjectType({ description: 'Some performances information about the server' })
export class Performances {
  @Field({ nullable: false })
  public memory: string = `Tot: ${totalmem()}, Free: ${freemem()}`;
}
